"""Structured-output schemas for Baseline A and Baseline B (Member 3).

These are the contracts the LLM is forced to fill in. Constraining generation
to a schema is what makes an unattended run of
30 functions x 3 systems x 3 repeats possible: no scraping code out of prose,
no markdown fences to strip, no half-parsed responses at 2am.

`ExecutionLog` mirrors schema/execution_log_schema.json (Member 1) so a run
can be validated against the team contract before it is written to logs/.
